$s = \sigma + \omega_d = \alpha + j\beta$
#### Natural frequency
$\omega_n = \sqrt{\sigma^2 + \omega_d^2}$
where $\omega_n$ is the natural frequency, $\sigma$ is the real part of an eigenvalue and $\omega_d$ is the imaginary part.
#### Damping ratio
$\zeta = -\frac{\sigma}{\omega_n}$
where $\zeta$ is the damping ratio.
